List of Questions:

1) What is your main goal for the next 30 days?
Answers (single select):

Lose body fat

Build muscle

Get stronger

Improve stamina (get less tired)

Improve mobility (move better, feel less stiff)

General fitness (balanced)

How it helps: This decides the overall style. For example, “build muscle” needs more resistance training volume and progression, while “stamina” needs more conditioning work.


2) Equipment access

Question: What equipment do you have access to? (Choose all that apply)
Answers:

No equipment (bodyweight only)

Resistance bands

Dumbbells

Kettlebell

Barbell and weight plates


Pull-up bar

Bench

Treadmill / cycle / rowing machine (cardio machines)

How it helps: This controls the exercise library. Fitbod calls out equipment as a key driver of what it can generate.

3) Time per workout

Question: How much time can you spend per workout?
Answers:

15 minutes

25 minutes

40 minutes

60 minutes

How it helps: This decides how many exercises you can fit, how much rest, and whether you can include warm-up and cardio. Fitbod highlights workout duration as a core setting for personalization.

4) Experience level

Question: What best describes your experience with workouts?
Answers:

Beginner (I have not worked out consistently)

Some experience (I have done it before, not consistent recently)

Intermediate (I train regularly and know basic form)

Advanced (I train regularly and track progress)

How it helps: This decides difficulty, exercise complexity, number of sets, and progression speed. Fitbod explicitly uses experience level in onboarding.

5 Current consistency (last 4 weeks)

Question: In the last 4 weeks, how often did you work out?
Answers:

0 days per week

1–2 days per week

3–4 days per week

5+ days per week

How it helps: This stops you from giving a “hard intermediate plan” to someone coming back after a break.

6) Pain or injury check (critical for safety and trust)

Question: Do you have pain or an injury that we should plan around?
Answers (multi-select):

None

Lower back

Knees

Shoulders

Neck

Wrists

Ankles

Other (short text)

How it helps: This prevents bad exercise choices. Freeletics uses the idea of “limitations” to exclude certain training stressors.

7) Movement restrictions (simple, non-medical)

Question: Are any of these difficult or not possible for you right now? (Choose all that apply)
Answers:

Squatting down is difficult

Lunges are difficult

Push-ups are difficult

Pull-ups are difficult

Jumping is difficult

Running is difficult

None

How it helps: This gives you practical constraints even when the user does not know how to describe injuries.

8) Workout style preference

Question: What kind of workouts do you enjoy more?
Answers:

Mostly strength training (lifting and bodyweight strength)

Mostly cardio (breathing hard, sweating)

Mix of both

I do not know (decide for me)

How it helps: Enjoyment is a major driver of adherence. If they hate cardio, a cardio-heavy plan will fail even if it is “optimal.”

9) Focus areas

Question: Which areas do you want to focus on? (Choose up to 2)
Answers:

Core (stomach and midsection strength)

Glutes and legs

Chest and arms

Back and posture

Full body balance (no focus)

How it helps: This helps you bias accessory exercises without breaking the overall balance.

10) Intensity preference

Question: How hard do you want workouts to feel most days?
Answers:

Easy (I want to build the habit first)

Moderate (challenging but doable)

Hard (I like intense workouts)

How it helps: This sets starting volume and pacing. It also reduces drop-off.


11) “Starting ability” quick check (optional, but very powerful)

Question: If you are comfortable, choose what you can do today.
Options (pick one per movement):

Push-ups: 0 / 1–5 / 6–15 / 16+

Bodyweight squats: 0–10 / 11–25 / 26–50 / 50+

Plank hold: under 20 seconds / 20–45 / 45–90 / 90+

Why it matters: Self-reported “intermediate” is often wrong. This gives a reality check.

12) Sleep and recovery (simple version)

Question: How is your sleep most nights?
Answers:

Under 6 hours

6–7 hours

7–8 hours

8+ hours

Why it matters: Poor recovery means you should start lighter and progress slower.

13) Preference exclusions (what they hate)

Question: Anything you strongly dislike or want to avoid?
Answers (multi-select):

Running

Jumping

Burpees

Long workouts

Heavy lifting

None

Other (text)

Why it matters: This prevents “personalized” plans that still feel annoying.

The categorization buckets you will get from these questions

Even with no machine learning, these answers let you place every user into clear buckets that drive plan generation:

Equipment bucket: bodyweight only vs light equipment vs full gym

Time bucket: 15 vs 25 vs 40 vs 60

Experience bucket: beginner vs intermediate vs advanced

Constraint flags: knee / back / shoulder / impact sensitive

Style bucket: strength-leaning vs cardio-leaning vs mixed

Intensity bucket: easy vs moderate vs hard

Focus bucket: core / lower body / upper body / posture

Schedule bucket: spaced recovery vs back-to-back days

That is enough to create plans that feel meaningfully different.
